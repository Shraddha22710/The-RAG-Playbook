# The-RAG-Playbook
# Awesome RAG Playbook — Governance-Aware Compliance Copilot (Learning + Starter Kit)

**Purpose:**  
This repository is a practical playbook for learning Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and building a small compliance-focused RAG prototype. It is designed for learners (students/engineers) and consultants who want a repeatable starter kit for document-grounded AI systems.

**What you will find:**
- Conceptual docs: RAG basics → advanced architectures → production concerns.
- Hands-on code: chunking, embeddings, FAISS index, retrieval, and a simple RAG demo.
- Multi-agent scaffold: DocumentAgent / RegulationAgent / GovernanceAgent examples.
- Mini demo app: Streamlit prototype to upload documents and see retrieved citations.
- Notebooks: interactive experiments and comparisons (LLM vs RAG, chunking effect).
