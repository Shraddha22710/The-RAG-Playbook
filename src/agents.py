# src/agents.py
"""
Simple agent scaffolding:
- DocumentAgent: Accepts uploaded text/PDF, returns extracted text chunks (uses OCR externally)
- RegulationAgent: Uses RAGPipeline to fetch relevant regulations
- GovernanceAgent: Applies business rules and composes final explanation (calls LLM via RAGPipeline)

This is intentionally simple to keep the capstone scope reasonable.
